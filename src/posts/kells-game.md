Because... why not?

I’ve been working on this little game called
[KELLS](https://twitter.com/KellsGame) in my spare time for the past six months.
Here's an early preview video that demonstrates the gameplay:

The goal is to guide your Kells (those little green dudes) to the exit flag by
changing gravity. You do this by attaching arrow blocks to the background which affect
gravity in different ways based on the direction of the chosen arrow.

Most of the work so far has been experimenting with how the gravity works and tweaking it for maximum fun - it’s not meant to be realistic by any stretch of the imagination. There is a long way to go. I'm no artist so the graphics are very basic at the moment and it’s also very confusing what the various gravity states are in some of the more complex levels so I need to add visual clues to make that more obvious.

Here are some screenshots:
