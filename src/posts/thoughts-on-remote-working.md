Now that the worst of covid is hopefully behind us, many companies are "encouraging"
their staff to come back to the office and this is a problem for many.

Why are people so strongly against this? After all, we all used to work in an office before
COVID and many people complained about the downsides of working from home when it all started
two years ago.

The thing is - this is not a question of whether it's advantageous or not to come together and
collaborate IRL. It's a question of who decides when and how often it's advantageous.

Most of us have not only grew accustomed to working from home and arranged our lives around
the flexibility of it, but we've also realised we can be flexible and be more productive working
this way. It's a win-win for everyone.

So why are companies wanting to get people back into the office when home working is more productive and
makes their staff happier?

That's the question to ask your manager when they gently enourage you to go into the office more. Just ask
why. What problem have you noticed that you think this will fix?

If manager's are concerned about people slacking off, you can refer to the fact you've been perforing extremely
well (if not better) during 2 years of remote working.
