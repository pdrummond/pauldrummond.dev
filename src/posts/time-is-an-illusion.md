Is the concept of time just an illision that only exists in our minds?

<!-- end -->

It appears to me to be our way of making sense of reality based on our limited senses of what's really going on. There is only "now" in reality - and we can't begin to imagine what that is like, so our minds layer up moment after moment to create the illusion of time. Previous moments are our memories, right now is reality and future moments are our imagination.

If we didn't have the ability to "layer up" moments in our minds, we wouldn't be able to make sense of music or speech for example.

Reminds me of my favourite film Memento. If the protagonist forgot everything every nanosecond instead of every 10-30 minutes or so, he would probably be completely in touch with reality and have no concept of time. If you put two Leonard Shelby's in a room, lock the door and observe what happens, they will eventually bump into each other but only from the observer's perspective (his mind observing the layering of moments). The Shelby's won't aware how many times they have bumped into each other or what "bumping into someone" is like (because even something as small as bumping into so is hundreds of little moments layered together in the mind).
