Minimum does not always mean small but the larger it is, the higher the risk.

When the P stands for Product it's to to solve a user's problem.

When the P stands for Prototype it's to generate feedback and insight.

If your MVP isn't being used for real to solve actual user problems, it's not an MVP.

You arrive at MVP by reshaping instead of breaking down.

MVP retains the essence without the depth or detail.

If you don't iterate on an MVP after launch, you can drop the M and the V.

If you launch MVP and it's not used right away, don't write any more code until you understand why.

If they aren't using it because something is missing, that's what you work on next.

If they like it but aren't ready to use it yet, you've got your priorities wrong.

If it doesn't solve their problem, you're working on the wrong thing. Good that you've found out early!
