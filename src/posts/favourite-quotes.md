> 42 doesn’t change. June 29th 2008 doesn’t change. Points don’t move, dates don’t change, no matter what some bad class libraries may cause you to believe. Even aggregates are values. The set of my favourite foods doesn’t change, i.e. if I prefer different foods in the future, that will be a different set."

> The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity.
> <br/>-- <cite>Dorothy Parker, (attributed)</cite>

> The problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.
> <br/>-- <cite>Joe Armstrong, interviewed in Coders at Work</cite>

> Programming is not about typing, it’s about thinking.
> <br/>-- <cite>Rich Hickey</cite>

> <br/>-- <cite>Raymmar Tirado</cite>

> The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.
> <br/>-- <cite>Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month</cite>

> Expose Your Ignorance. Tomorrow I need to look stupider and feel better about it. This staying quiet and trying to guess what’s going on isn’t working so well.
> <br/>-- <cite>Aras Atasaygin on Apprenticeship Patterns</cite>

> Because you are comfortable in your mediocrity; because you choose not to try.
> <br/>-- <cite>Raymmar Tirado</cite>

> You can reach a point with Lisp where, between the conceptual simplicity, the large libraries, and the customization of macros, you are able to write only code that matters. And, once there, you are able to achieve a very high degree of focus, such as you would when playing Go, or playing a musical instrument, or meditating. And then, as with those activities, there can be a feeling of elation that accompanies that mental state of focus.
> <br/>-- <cite>Rich Hickey</cite>

> <br/>-- <cite>George Vaillant, March 2008 newsletter to the Grant Study</cite>

> I’m now convinced that choosing a language based on how easy it is to read or write is a very bad idea. What if we chose musical instruments based on how easy they are to play? Everyone would playing kazoos. You can’t think deeply about music if all you know is a kazoo. Skill at reading and writing code is learned. We should choose languages based on how accurately they allow us to think about the problems we are trying to solve.
> <br/>-- <cite>Brenton Ashworth on Clojure</cite>

> When you let the nose of the camel into the tent, the rest of him tends to follow
