A collection of tech quotes that I keep adding to as I discover more!

> Programming is a way of thinking, not a rote skill. Learning about "for" loops
> is not learning to program, any more than learning about pencils is learning
> to draw.
> <br/>-- <cite>Bret Victor</cite>

> There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.
> <br/>-- <cite>Bjarne Stroustrup</cite>

> In order to understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.
> <br/>-- <cite>ANNON</cite>

> 42 doesn’t change. June 29th 2008 doesn’t change. Points don’t move, dates
> don’t change, no matter what some bad class libraries may cause you to
> believe. Even aggregates are values. The set of my favourite foods doesn’t
> change, i.e. if I prefer different foods in the future, that will be a
> different set.
> <br/>-- <cite>Rich Hickey on State and Identity</cite>

> The problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit
> environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you
> got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.
> <br/>-- <cite>Joe Armstrong, interviewed in Coders at Work</cite>

> Programming is not about typing, it’s about thinking.
> <br/>-- <cite>Rich Hickey</cite>

> The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure
> thought-stuff. He builds castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of
> the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and
> rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.
> <br/>-- <cite>Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month</cite>

> Someday, not being proficient with computers will be considered a form of illiteracy.
> <br/>-- <cite>Naval Ravikant</cite>
