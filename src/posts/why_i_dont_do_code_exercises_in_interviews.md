It’s easy as an interviewer to forget how one-sided the interview process can
be.

---

To the interviewer, it’s just another meeting in a familiar environment
where you know exactly what’s going to happen. To the candidate however, it
could be life-changing, everything is unknown, it’s an unfamiliar environment
and they have no idea what to expect. This puts the candidate at an immediate
disadvantage. Unless this situation is remedied right off the bat, there is
a high chance of false-positives. My approach is to cut through all the
inequality right at the start and get both parties on the same level as
quickly as possible so I can be as confident we have the right person for the
role.
