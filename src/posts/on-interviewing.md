My thoughts on the interview process and whether technical coding tests are
worth it.

<!-- end -->

I prefer a single-stage "informal chat" approach where possible. Often I find
this approach to be more than enough to get a good idea of a candidate's
skillset, especially if they have a lot of experience. I don't see very much
value in technical code tests. In my opinion the only thing worse than a
mandated technical code test is an on-the-spot, while-we-watch mandated
technical code test. Even if the candidate works well under pressure, you're
still testing their ability to perform under unrealistic and impractical
conditions, so who cares if they are good at something completely irrelevant to
the role?

Sometimes - if torn and unable to decide one way or the other, maybe an offline
coding exercise time-boxed to a week or so might give me some help towards
deciding one way or another, but even that is often fraught with
false-negatives. In general, in my experience a coding exercise is just not
worth it. That's probably because I'm not really looking for low-level
programming skills anyway. I'm looking for candidates who posses the following
skills:

1. **Strong communication skills** - can tell when to be more/less technical,
   value knowledge sharing, good at listening to others before diving in with
   their own opinion. Ability to communicate well without becoming offensive or
   defensive. Ability to take and actively seek constructive criticism.
2. **Enjoys learning** - not stuck in their way, always considering different
   approaches to problems, learning benefits of new
   languages/frameworks/technologies objectively without latching on blindly to
   the hype train.
3. **Good collaborator** - ability to defend position without being defensive,
   not afraid to run ideas by other team members, respects “heads down” time as
   well.
4. **Can deal with failure** - identify problems objectively. Learn from
   mistakes. Doesn't make the same mistakes over and over.
5. **Humility** - always being open to alternative solutions. Not afraid to
   admit mistakes. Ability to accept being wrong and consider alternative
   approaches. Doesn't have an attitude where they assume their solution is of
   higher standard than “lesser” colleagues. Acceptance that sometimes the best
   solution might not be technically the best, but it's the best compromise due
   to the teams/scenarios involved.
6. **Good at mentoring and being mentored** - happy to acknowledge areas where
   they need mentoring while also actively helping others when they can in an
   approachable way.
7. **Good problem solving skills** - value concepts over specifics, critical
   thinking, good at investigating root cause of problems and so on.
8. **Strong work ethic based on trust** - good working autonomously and being
   rated based on performance as opposed to heavy-handed time-based
   micro-management (which usually occurs due to a lack of trust).
9. **Technically Minded** - strong on general high-level programming concepts,
   strong interest in technical problem solving, good technical background in
   general.

Obviously, it's important to be able to actually code as well! But it's
definitely not the most important skill and besides, it's much easier to figure
out if someone can code than it is to score them on the above criteria. Being a
Software Engineer is all about people skills, whether devs like it or not! Even
the most technically-focused role is still more about working in a team than
being shit hot at a particular language who hates talking to anyone. In general,
code readability is far more important than using advanced coding techniques
that reduce readability. The ability to clearly and patiently teach how a system
works in an approachable and non-offensive manner is far more important than
being the only dev in the building who can use it. It really is all about being
a team player.

When I tell people I conduct interviews as an informal chat, sometimes they get
the wrong impression and presume I'm just being lazy or that it's just an easy
way out so I can get it over with, but it's quite the opposite! Conducting
interviews fairly and with a view to getting as much value out of them as
possible for both parties is one of the hardest parts of my job. I find
candidates respond to the "informal chat" format extremely well, not because
it's easy but because they feel like they are being seen as individuals and
being treated fairly. Both parties appreciate the lack of pointless bureaucracy
and nonsense that is so common these days. It gives off a really good impression
about the type of company we are as well. It also helps to relax the candidate
and make them feel at ease so we can really focus on finding out if they are a
good fit for us and if we are a good fit for them. It re-frames it from a
one-sided meeting with an interviewer leading from a position of superiority and
an air of suspicion to something far more authentic and effective - an equal
back-and-forth chat where the candidate is just as likely to be asking the
questions as the interviewer.

A lot of interviewers start by describing the role. This is a waste of time
because most of the time the the candidate isn't even listening at this stage!
They are too busy freaking out whether there will be an on-the-spot technical
test! This is why I always start by explaining up-front there will be no tests
or on-the-spot technical trivia during this interview and it will be an informal
discussion structured around their CV. I find this instantly puts them at
ease. Next, I ask the candidate to walk through their CV and give an overview of
each role, their technical skills, programming languages experience, etc. I try
very hard not to interrupt them during this part - the purpose of it is to
provide the context for the rest of the discussion, so I'm hoping they cover a
wide range of topics that I can revisit when asking questions later. One way I
avoid interrupting is because I'm too busy writing notes but I have to be
careful about doing so. I often make a joke _"I have a terrible memory so I'm
just writing down reminders so I can't come back to them later"_ or something
like that. Again, this puts them at ease and helps prevent them from wondering
_"what is he writing about me? Did I just say something wrong?"_.

After the candidate has finished summarising their CV, I begin asking questions
such as “what are you most proud of?” and “can you discuss a project you hated
and why” and “discuss a time when you made a mistake and had to recover”.
However, it’s better to avoid asking those questions generically without any
context as that puts the candidate on the spot and they might rush and choose a
suboptimal example. So I try to focus the questions on the candidate’s
experience as that makes it easier for them to choose ideal examples from
stories they have already mentioned in their CV summary.

Here are some more guidelines I follow for getting the best out of the
discussion:

1. I always have some questions prepared beforehand but I try to avoid generic
   questions - they should be always be based on the candidate’s CV if possible.

2. I try to steer candidates towards talking about high level concepts in a
   back-and-forth chat format rather than short, specific answers to low-level
   programming trivia. For example, if immutability comes up, rather than a
   generic question such as “What is immutability?”, I try to frame it as a
   discussion by asking something like “You mentioned immutability when talking
   about Project X a minute ago. Can you tell us more about that?” Hopefully the
   candidate will discuss why they did it, maybe even go into some functional
   aspects of it and talk about their other experiences with it (maybe in
   different programming languages where it is enforced for example).
3. Throughout, I'm always trying to get a feel for if they are a good fit. I'm
   looking out for all the qualities listed in the section above and looking for
   opportunities to dig a little deeper on any one of these qualities based on
   what they are saying.
4. I always try to take notice of how the candidate acts when discussing their
   experience. Are they enthusiastic? Are they pragmatic? Are they passionate?
5. If they bring up certain technologies/frameworks, I ask them to dive into it
   a bit more if they haven’t already and try to focus their answer on a
   specific real-world example. Questions such as _“What did you think of it?”_,
   _"What company did you use it at?"_, _“Advantages/disadvantages”_ and _“would
   you use it in the future (if not, why not)?”_
6. Some general topics I like to consider depending on the type of role:
   1. High level thoughts on databases - not necessarily AWS but in general.
      Experience in relational databases? Thoughts on NoSQL, maybe they discuss
      a specific technology like Mongo. That's fine but try to steer them
      towards the high level aspects of it rather than getting bogged down in
      technical detail.
   2. Thoughts on testing. Looking for a pragmatic approach to things like TDD.
      I'm looking for them to discuss their experience with unit testing
      honestly. It's far better if they discuss openly how they struggled with
      coverage based on a real example rather than some textbook _"always test
      everything"_ generic answer.
   3. Thoughts on pair programming. Prefer honest _"It has its uses but … "_
      answers over systematic answers like _"I would enforce it and expect it
      to be implemented perfectly via the following 50 steps"_ or overly
      extreme and blunt answers like _"I hate it and I always refuse"_ (Unless
      that's intended as a joke of course!).
   4. What do they think about UI/UX? Look out for bad attitudes like _"UI is
      simple"_ or _"UI doesn't matter"_. Do they care about UX? Do they talk
      about an experience they've had before where they dealt with colleagues
      who didn't care about it?
   5. Thoughts on different types of programming languages such as functional
      programming, OOP, etc. Again, looking for high-level opinions, not
      specific programming details around syntax.
   6. Thoughts on software delivery process based on specific examples form
      past experience. Things like continuous integration, continuous delivery.
      Benefits, drawbacks, etc.

It’s easy as an interviewer to forget how one-sided the interview process can
be. To the interviewer, it’s just another meeting in a familiar environment
where they know exactly what’s going to happen and what they are looking for. To
the candidate, it could be life-changing, everything is unknown, it’s an
unfamiliar environment and they have no idea what to expect or how they are
going to be treated. This puts the candidate at an immediate disadvantage.
Unless this situation is remedied right at the start, there is an extremely high
chance of false-negatives and a danger the entire interview will end up being a
waste of time for both parties. Or worse, the interviewer may make a decision to
hire or reject the candidate based on these false-negative which sadly, is
often the case.

To summarise, the informal-chat approach is based on the interviewer and the
candidate starting from a position of equality forming a balanced discussion
with questions coming from both parties where the goal is clear - to find out if
the company is a good fit for the candidate and vice-versa.
