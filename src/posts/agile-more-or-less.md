## Agile development isn’t about squeezing 6 months of work into 2 weeks!

The team tend not to think of it as "6 months of work" anyway. They focus on getting inside the head of customers (which is very difficult and
requires a skilled Product Manager to be a member of the team) to identify their biggest problems and needs, then work on a solution that focuses in on the core problem.

It’s about the team reducing the scope to the most important thing the customer needs and if that’s possible in 2 weeks, fantastic. Often it’s not, but as long as the team is trying to reduce the scope to essential functionality, that’s what’s important.

More agile is when you ditch chapters altogether and write a blog post instead.

Less agile is when you work alone on your book for years without sharing with anyone.

More agile is when you share your blog post early then iterate on it in public.

Less agile is hoping your book will be successful only to find out way too late it doesn't get your message across very well.

More agile is relishing feedback on your blog post (positive and negative) so you can learn from it and publish a better version (or a part 2).

Less agile is feeling like a failure when your book doesn't sell very well.

More agile is treating failure as an opportunity to learn and refine your messsage or change it completely if necessary.

Less agile is holding off until your book is perfect for fear of criticism.

More agile is not being afraid to get your message out there early.

Less agile is always striving for perfection and endeavoring to never make any mistakes let alone learn from them.

More agile is being bold enough to make mistakes - and learn from them - in public.

Less agile is incessantly rewriting chapters, striving for perfection, refusing to accept feedback and always finding a way to hold off from publishing.

More agile is iterating on your message gradually until eventually you end up writing a full blown book anyway (and a very successful one at that!).
