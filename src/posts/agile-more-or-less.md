draft: true

> Less agile is like writing an entire book up front, where each task is like chapters of a book.

> More agile is when you ditch chapters altogether and write a blog post instead.

> Less agile is when you work alone on your book for years without sharing with anyone.

> More agile is sharing your blog post in draft form then iterating on it in public.

> Less agile is hoping your book will be successful, only to find out way too late it's not what your readers were expecting.

> More agile is relishing feedback on your blog post, even if it's negative so you can publish a better version (or a part 2).

> Less agile is feeling like a failure when your epic novel doesn't sell.

> More agile is flipping failure on its head and treating it like an opportunity to pivot and publish a better version.

> More agile is not being afraid to get your message out there early.

> Less agile is holding off until your novel is perfect for fear of criticism.

> More agile is being bold enough to make mistakes - and learn from them - in public.

> Less agile is always striving for perfection and endeavoring to never make mistakes, let alone learn from them.

> More agile is iterating on your message gradually until eventually you end up writing a full blown book anyway (and a very successful one at that!).

> Less agile is incessantly rewriting chapters, striving for perfection, refusing to accept feedback and always finding a way to hold of publication.
