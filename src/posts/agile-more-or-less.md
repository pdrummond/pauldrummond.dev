Less agile is like writing an entire non-fiction book up front where each task is like chapters of a book

More agile is when you ditch chapters altogether and write a blog post instead

Less agile is when you work alone on your book for years without sharing with anyone

More agile is when you share your blog post early then iterate on it in public

Less agile is hoping your book will be successful only to find out way too late it doesn't get your message across very well

More agile is relishing feedback on your blog post (positive and negative) so you can learn from it and publish a better version (or a part 2)

Less agile is feeling like a failure when your book doesn't sell very well

More agile is treating failure as an opportunity to learn and refine your messsage or change it completely if necessary

Less agile is holding off until your book is perfect for fear of criticism

More agile is not being afraid to get your message out there early

Less agile is always striving for perfection and endeavoring to never make any mistakes let alone learn from them

More agile is being bold enough to make mistakes - and learn from them - in public

Less agile is incessantly rewriting chapters, striving for perfection, refusing to accept feedback and always finding a way to hold off from publishing

More agile is iterating on your message gradually until eventually you end up writing a full blown book anyway (and a very successful one at that!).
